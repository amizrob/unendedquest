  <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
  Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
  Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
  Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
  The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
  And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
  My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
  Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
  Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
  The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
