<h1>some notes on stoicism</h1>
<button>Posted on January 8, 2018</button>

<p>What’s your philosophy of life? Irvine defines a philosophy of life comprising of two steps, creation of goals and learning techniques to achieve those goals. And stoicism is one such philosophy. The aim of stoicism is the maintenance of tranquility, or reduction/domestication of negative emotions.</p>

<p>I think it’s better to describe stoicism as a technique, like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) rather than a philosophy. Viewed as a technique it can always be modified over time to fit people’s needs. Irvine does a great job of explaining what stoicism is, and synthesizing a pretty nice and easily applicable technique. He draws from works of mainly four stoic philosophers: Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. This book shouldn’t be viewed as a history of stoics and stoicism, or exploration of all different views and techniques of stoicism. It is a synthesis, by Irvine, of a practical/applicable technique to help people. In synthesizing a coherent technique, Irvine has to pick and choose certain teachings and dismiss others, because ancient stoics had differing views from each other and some of their own views were contradictory. Also Stoicism is a much bigger philosophy covering everything from theories of physics to theories of knowledge. Here when I refer to stoicism I mean ‘that part of stoicism that deals with humans and their emotions’.</p>

<p>Stoicism shouldn’t be confused with asceticism. Although it was influenced by asceticism and some stoics were ascetic-leaning. Stoicism is about taming and minimization of negative emotions, not denying of worldly pleasures. Also stoicism shouldn’t be viewed as a philosophy preaching complacency. Stoic philosophy is compatible with general improvement of human lot. Stoic techniques can help you deal with your poor worldly condition, and hence reduce your suffering. But it doesn’t dictate that you should remain in poor condition. For example, some stoic philosopher were among the richest people of their times, like Marcus Aurelius (was the emperor of Rome) and Seneca (was a very rich businessman).</p>

<h4>the trichotomy of control</h4>
‘<em>Some things are up to us and some are not up to us.</em>’ – Epictetus

<p>Epictetus divided everything concerning people into two domains—things external to us and things internal. It’s the divide between things you don’t have control over and things you have control over. Irvine turns Epictetus’ dichotomy into a trichotomy by further subdividing the latter category into two: things we don’t have ‘any control over’ and things we have ‘some, but not complete control’.<br><br>
We always get stressed and anxious about all sorts of stuff, because we don’t bother to stop and reflect on why we are suffering. The Trichotomy of Control is the technique for sorting out different situations/goals and reduce the amount of anxiety, fear, stress, etc. in your life. We have different amounts of control over different goals and situations.</p>
